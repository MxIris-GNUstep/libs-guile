What is the GNUstep Guile Library?
==================================

   The gnustep_guile library lets you use (and extend) the GNUstep
libraries from within Guile.  This effectively provides you with
scripting language for GNUstep and an interactive system for developing
GNUstep applications.

=====================================

   * Updated to support guile 1.6 and to support the latest GNUstep
     base and gui libraries.

   * Added support for gdl2 by David Ayers.

   * Handle either debug or non-debug libraries (preferably debug)

Where can you get it?  How can you compile it?
==============================================

   The gnustep-guile-1.1.0.tar.gz distribution file has been placed at
