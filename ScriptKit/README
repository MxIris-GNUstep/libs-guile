1. What's "ScriptKit"?
======================

You can merge GNUstep environment and GUILE interpreter with the ScriptKit
class library. The ScriptKit makes it possible to evaluate GUILE scripts
from GNUstep programs. As an interface library of GNUstep and GUILE,
its role looks like the gstep_guile library, but the direction of
communications the library supports is opposite.

The gstep_guile supports to use the GNUstep libraries to send messages
to GNUstep classes and objects from GUILE scripts. On the other hand,
the ScriptKit helps to evaluate guile script from GNUstep applications.

You can use the gstep_guile and ScriptKit at the same time. For example,
thinking about the GUILE script written with gstep_guile to send the
messages to GNUstep classes. You can evaluate such a script from GNUstep
applications written with ScriptKit, and vice versa.

You can do the same thing only with gstep_guile and GUILE.
But the things described as above will be more clearly, when you use
the ScriptKit.

  a. correspondence of GNUstep variables with GUILE variables
  b. SCM type handling
  c. GNUstep exceptions and GUILE exceptions

See the chapter 4 "ScriptKit Tutorials" for more informations.


2. History of "ScriptKit"
=========================

The first version of ScriptKit was written by David I. Lehn <dlehn@vt.edu>.
But he gave up to maintenance it, so we, GYVE developers, took over its
maintenance work. The ScriptKit was merged into gstep_guile in March 1999.
However, we've still been working on it. Please send the bug reports and
your suggestions to following address:

3. Installation instructions
============================

As the ScriptKit was merged into gstep_guile, if you installed gstep_guile,
the ScriptKit is already available for use. If so, skip this chapter.

3.1 Before you start
--------------------

 * gstep_guile

Before installing the ScriptKit, you must install gstep_guile and its
corresponding softwares like guile-1.3, gstep-core, gcc 2.8.x or later. 

3.2 Configuring and building the software
-----------------------------------------

You can just type

 sh configure

and let the configure script construct appropriate configuration files.
configure has two special options as follows:
 
  * --with-guile-prefix=PFX     

  With this option, you can specify where the plathome independent guile
  files are.

  * --with-guile-exec-prefix=PFX        

  With this option, you can specify where the plathome dependent guile
  files are.

Now, just say:

 make
 make install

NOTE: If you want to produce debugging information, use debug=yes option
as follows:

 make debug=yes
 make install debug=yes

3.3 Testing the software
------------------------

As a quick test of functionality, run "run_test.sh" in the ScriptKit/Library
directory.
