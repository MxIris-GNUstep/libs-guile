Required software
-----------------

   * gstep-guile	
     Available from <ftp://ftp.gnustep.org/pub/gnustep/libs>

     or, for the bleeding edge - availably by anonymous cvs -

     CVSROOT=":pserver:anoncvs@cvs.net-community.com:/gnustep"
     export CVSROOT
     cvs login (password is `anoncvs')
     cvs -z3 checkout guile

   * guile-1.3.4		
     Should be available from any GNU ftp site
     NB. guile 1.3 contains bugs that prevent gstep-guile from working
     fully.

   * gstep-core-0.6.5	
     Available from <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gstep> or see
     <http://www.gnustep.org/> for further information.

   * gcc-2.8.*
     Gcc should be available from any GNU ftp site
     You may also use a recent version of egcs.
     NB. For debugging, you need gdb-4.17 with the objc patch.  The
     patch for gdb-4.17 is available at
     <ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/gnustep/contrib/>

Build and Install
-----------------

   * Make sure you have gcc-2.8.* installed.

   * Make sure you have Guile-1.3.4 or later built and installed.  This
     library has been tested with 1.3.4.  The library does not work
     fully with Guile-1.3

   * Make sure you have gstep-core-0.6.5 (or later) installed and have
     your account properly set up to use GNUstep.sh from the gstep-make
     package to set up your environment.

   * Run the `configure' script.

   * To build the entire gstep-guile package, simply type 'make'

   * To install - become root and type 'make install' The installation
     process will copy the library into place and will also copy Guile
     scripts into place.

   * To test it - type 'make check'.
     This will use the 'go' program (built in the Test directory) to
     run the tests in 'Test/tests'.
     Alternatively - you can run the 'go' program directly and work
     interactively.


Trouble
-------

   This package has only been used by me on a GNU/Linux/Intel system -
I would love to hear about success/failures on other systems.

   Likely problems -

   * If you install gstep-guile in a non-standard location, it's
     possible that guile will not be able to find the dynamic libraries
     to load them.  In this case, you will need to change/set the
     `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable (or whatever other
     environment variable your operating system uses to list the places
     in which dynamic libraries may be found) to include the directory
     in which the libraries have been installed.

   * Structure return is likely to fail on other systems.  It should be
     possible for you to fix things for your system by adding a config
     file in the src/mframe directory in gstep-base and re-running
     'configure' and rebuilding the base library - however, getting a
     working system for your machine/operatins system is likely to be
     quite tricky.

   Try to fix the problem.  Send patches to <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>.
