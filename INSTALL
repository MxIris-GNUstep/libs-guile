Required software
-----------------

   * guile-1.4		
     Should be available from any GNU ftp site
     NB. guile 1.3 contains bugs that prevent gnustep-guile from
     working fully.

   * gnustep-make-1.2.1 and gnustep-base-1.1.0	or greater
     Available from <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnustep> or see
     <http://www.gnustep.org/> for further information.

   * gcc-2.8.* or greater
     Gcc 3.0 is recommended and should be available from any GNU ftp
     site
     NB. For debugging, you need gdb-4.17 with the objc patch.  The
     patch for gdb-4.17 is available at
     <ftp://ftp.gnustep.org/pub/gnustep/contrib/>

Build and Install
-----------------

   * Make sure you have a recent gcc installed.

   * Make sure you have Guile-1.3.4 or later built and installed.  This
     library has been tested with 1.4 and 1.3.4.  The library does not
     work fully with Guile-1.3

   * Make sure you have gnustep-make and gnustep-base version 1.0.1 or
     better installed and have your account properly set up to use
     GNUstep.sh from the gnustep-make package to set up your
     environment.

   * Run the `configure' script.

   * To build the entire gnustep-guile package, simply type 'make'

   * To install - become root and type 'make install' The installation
     process will copy the library into place and will also copy Guile
     scripts into place.

   * To test it - type 'make check'.
     This will use the 'go' program (built in the Test directory) to
     run the tests in 'Test/tests'.
     Alternatively - you can run the 'go' program directly and work
     interactively.


Trouble
-------

   I would love to hear about success/failures on other systems.

   Likely problems:

   * If you install gnustep-guile in a non-standard location, it's
     possible that guile will not be able to find the dynamic libraries
     to load them.  In this case, you will need to change/set the
     `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable (or whatever other
     environment variable your operating system uses to list the places
     in which dynamic libraries may be found) to include the directory
     in which the libraries have been installed.

   * Structure return might fail on other systems. Check the portability
     of the ffcall library if you experience problems.  If ffcall
     doesn't work, getting a working system for your machine/operatins
     system is likely to be quite tricky.

   Try to fix the problem.  Send patches to <richard@brainstorm.co.uk>.
